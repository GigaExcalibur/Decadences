[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Um. Excuse me. You're[Beat] Aleyna, correct?[AN]
The mercenary captain Ge- Eugenia hired?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Sigh. Eugenia assured me you wouldn't[N]
ask any stupid questions during battle.[AN]
[ML]Hey! It's not my fault I'm bad with names![AN]
[MR]That's ex- no, I'm not dealing with this now.[AN]
Yes, I'm Aleyna. Now leave me alone and let[N]
me do the job I was contracted for.[AN]
[ML]Wait, please! Just one more thing. If you[N]
answer it I'll never bother you again.[AN]
Your face[Beat] it feels familiar to me.[AN]
Have we met before?[A] Certainly not after[N]
my father died.[AN]
[MR]This isn't the time for idle chatter.[AN]
Get back to battle.[A] Now.[AN]
[ML][CloseEyes]You're in your forties, which means it's[N]
possible we met when I was a child[Beat][OpenEyes][AN]
[MR]Darina![A] This is your last warning![AN]
Leave. Me. Alone. You and I have[N]
never met, end of story.[AN]
[ML][MoML]Huh?! What?! Ah, did I cross a boundary?[AN]
I'm so, so, so sorry! I had no idea.[AN]
Hells, why does this keep happening?![AN][ClearFace]
[MR]Damn, that's gonna hurt my chances of[N]
Eugenia ever hiring my company again.[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Whatever. So long as I never have to[N]
see that bastard Duncan's face again,[N]
it'll all be worth it.[A][X]

## EugeniaCalvinTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEugenia][MR][LoadCalvin]
[MR]Yo, Eugenia! I've come to cash in a favor.[AN]
[ML]I had a feeling you'd be doing so[N]
eventually. Name your price.[AN]
[MR]So agreeable. That's what I love about you,[N]
you know? Now then, I'm looking for info.[AN]
Info on House Vacille's Four Sacred Treasures.[AN]
Three were stolen from the estate when Lord[N]
Darina was crowned seven years ago.[AN]
They've changed hands between various[N]
elites hundreds of times since then.[AN]
A businesswoman of your repute would be[N]
privy to the trade deals of these relics.[AN]
Where are they located right now?[AN]
[ML]Clearly you've done your homework. Very[N]
well, I'll tell you what you're after.[AN]
It's the least I can do for you keeping[N]
the Ruby Gem in House Vacille's hands.[AN]
As for the other three, here's what I know.[AN]
The Sapphire Gem is in the hands of a[N]
black market dealer in the castle town.[AN]
He lives in a house southeast of us.[AN]
The Onyx Gem is in the hands of a[N]
war profiteer named Ava Rice.[AN]
And finally, the Gold gem fell into[N]
the hands of the church.[AN]
No idea where it's being kept now,[N]
sorry I can't be any more specific.[AN]
[MR]I'm sure it's out there adorning[N]
the head of a staff somewhere.[AN]
Thanks Eugenia, we're even now.[AN]
[ML]I'm glad you said that. Cause now if I catch[N]
you stealing the Ruby Gem, I won't show mercy.[AN]
Now, if this was all you required of me, I'm[N]
returning to battle.[A] Pleasure doing business.[AN][ClearFace]
[MR]Heh. By the time you notice it's gone, I'll[N]
already be off this godsdamned continent.[AN]
Now then, trying to acquire all four of[N]
the Sacred Treasures is too dangerous.[AN]
Three is enough to buy my freedom, and a[N]
nice birthday gift for Clovis to boot.[A][X]

## DuncanNiravTalkConvo
[MR][LoadDuncan][ML][LoadNirav]
[MR]Knights! Fall in line! The enemy has[N]
breached the castle gates![AN]
Plug those choke points like your life[N]
depends on it, because it DOES![AN]
Dewan, do you understand me?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML][Beat][AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Dewan! I said, do you understand me?![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Loud. And. Clear. Commander[Beat][AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Don't give me that attitude, rookie.[AN]
You think I don't notice the way your[N]
eyes skitter back and forth in battle?[AN]
If I don't keep you on a close leash,[N]
you're gonna fly the coop.[AN]
[ML]If you're gonna chew me out, at least[N]
keep your animal metaphors consistent.[AN]
[MR]Oh, I'm [Italics]sorry[Normal]. Would you prefer a cage?[AN]
Would you rather be still be stuck in those[N]
bars you called a home in House Dewan?[AN]
I saved you.[A] I convinced your parents[N]
to let you enlist in this army.[AN]
It's because of me that you know how[N]
the [Italics]real[Normal] world works.[AN]
[ML]And is this the real world, Commander?![AN]
Nothing but men bleeding each other out?[AN]
[MR]Damn straight. A man's place in this[N]
world is to fight.[A] Fight, then die.[AN]
If you can't handle that, then you're[N]
welcome to turn tail and fly back home.[AN]
But if you choose to stay here, you[N]
obey my every command without question.[AN]
[ML]Nngh[Beat][AN]
[MR]Bah. I need to get back into the fight.[AN]
My axe shall sanctify this battle, and[N]
baptize my enemies in their own blood![AN][ClearFace]
[ML]Is this truly all that awaits me[N]
beyond the walls of House Dewan?[AN]
No[Beat] no! I refuse to believe it![AN]
I'm done being trapped in cages![AN]
I have to get out of here![N]
I have to be free![A][X]

## EkaitzEmersonTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEmerson][MR][LoadEkaitz]
[ML]Mister! I must ask you to stop dragging[N]
your feet across the castle floor.[AN]
Your filthy shoes are undoing all[N]
my hard work.[AN]
[MR]The hell's a kid lecturing me for?[AN]
Listen, buddy, didn't you ever learn[N]
to always leave adults alone?[AN]
[ML]I don't recall ever being[N]
taught that by my father.[AN]
[MR]Ah, you see, that's the problem with[N]
today's youth: no respect for elders.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]And how old you are, mister?[AN]
[MR]Thirty five.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Thirty five?! I beat men your age[N]
in sparring matches every day![AN]
And I doubt you're as highly[N]
trained in combat as them.[AN]
[MR]Ha! Sparring matches are as worthless[N]
a measure as a dead horse in a race.[AN]
People in the real world don't fight[N]
by the rules. Take it from me.[AN]
I've fought dirty to get where I am[N]
today, and I'm not ashamed of it.[AN]
[ML]That's not true! If I'm strong[N]
enough, I can beat any cheater.[AN]
[MR]You've got guts, I'll give you that much.[AN]
Tell you what. What say we make a wager?[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]If you grow and become eligible for[N]
a promotion, I'll consider you capable[N]
enough to survive honorably.[AN]
And if that happens, I'll listen to[N]
you when you tell me to wipe my feet.[AN]
Sound fair?[AN]
[ML]It's a deal, mister![A][X]

## ClovisSolineTalkConvo
[L][LoadSoline][MoMR]
[MR]Ethereal gatekeepers, heed my command![AN]
Dispel the barrier betwen these planes;[N]
let my devotion pierce Hells' gates![AN]
[ML][LoadClovis]
[ML]Stop right there, you heathen![AN][CloseBox]
[MR][ClearFace]
[ML]You stand in the presence of Clovis[N]
Lucian, priest of the Grasdian Order![AN]
In the name of all that is sacred,[N]
I command you to cease this ritual![AN]
[Beat][AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
Oh joy, another one of you holy types.[AN]
Can't you people let an old woman be[N]
concealed in a castle in peace?![AN]
[ML]As soon as you witches start respecting[N]
the sanctity of life.[AN]
[MR]Hells, not another sanctity of life lecture.[AN]
We necromancers slave over our rituals to[N]
ensure our resurrections are seamless.[AN]
That our subjects return to us the[N]
same way they departed.[AN]
Is our pursuit for eternal life not in[N]
alignment with your ideals of life?[AN]
You blind hypocrites[Beat][AN]
[ML]Silence, wretch. Once this battle is over,[N]
I'm going to see you burned at the stake.[AN]
[MR]Hah! You really think you can? House[N]
Vacille has sheltered me for decades.[AN]
Lord Darina would never obey the[N]
orders of the church to turn me over.[AN]
[ML]The Grasdian Order wields considerable[N]
influence within Clarvoan politics.[AN]
If Lord Darina chose to fulfill her[N]
duty to them, your fate is sealed.[AN]
[MR]I have no doubt Lord Darina will make[N]
the correct choice[Beat] at least once.[AN]
But in the meantime, you have more pressing[N]
matters than harassing an old woman.[AN]
After all, we're on the same side.[AN]
And Clovis, one day I hope you're[N]
able to move past this hypocrisy.[AN]
Imagine what Calvin would say if he[N]
saw you in such a state[Beat] heh heh.[A][X]
