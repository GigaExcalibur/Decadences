[ML][LoadCalvin]
[ML]That's the Red Gem in hand![AN]
Now to start tracking down the[N]
ones not located in the castle.[A][X]

## SapphireGemAcquiredCalvin
[ML][LoadCalvin]
[ML]Glad I was able to get the[N]
Sapphire Gem while I could.[AN]
Just a few more to go, now.[A][X]

## OnyxGemAcquiredCalvin
[ML][LoadCalvin]
[ML]The Onyx Gem is back in the[N]
hands of its rightful owner.[AN]
Is that all of them?[A][X]

## RubyGemAcquiredClovis
[ML][LoadClovis]
[ML]Oh? Isn't this the Ruby Gem?[AN]
Calvin told me to hold onto it[N]
in case it fell into my hands.[AN]
I wonder where the others are.[A][X]

## SapphireGemAcquiredClovis
[ML][LoadClovis]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]So this is the Sapphire Gem.[A] I heard[N]
was being hidden in the castle town,[N]
but didn't believe any of the rumors.[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]It's safest in my hands until I[N]
find an opportunity to return it.[A][X]

## OnyxGemAcquiredClovis
[ML][LoadClovis]
[ML]So[Beat] Ava had the Onyx Gem on her.[AN]
I shudder to think what horrors she[N]
wrought in exchange for the stone.[AN]
I'll keep this with me, so that it[N]
will not tempt atrocities again.[A][X]

## GoldGemAcquired
[ML][LoadClovis]
[ML]Oh, it seems my staff is out of energy.[AN]
It would be a shame to throw it away,[N]
especially with such a beautiful head.[AN]
I'll keep this as a memento.[A][X]

[ML][LoadCalvin][MR][LoadClovis]
[ML]Clovis! Three of the Sacred Treasures[N]
are now in our hands![AN]
[MR]What fortune! We can return House Vacille's[N]
relics to their original home.[AN]
[ML]Clovis[Beat] you should know, I-[AN]
[MR]You want us to keep them, right? I know.[AN]
You've been planning this ever since[N]
the two of us got together.[AN]
[ML]Then why didn't you say anything?[AN]
[MR]I suppose[Beat] I wanted to indulge.[AN]
I wanted to fantasize a life where I[N]
left everything behind to be with you.[AN]
A sinful impulse, I know, especially[N]
given the actions you took for my sake.[AN]
But I never dreamed that you'd really[N]
succeed at securing the stones.[AN]
Looking at the way they shine, I[Beat][N]
I confess I'm at a loss.[AN]
My fantasies, my dreams, they're[N]
all finally within my grasp.[AN]
But is this all a test of my faith?[AN]
Is my happiness worth the cost of[N]
those beautiful gems?[AN]
[ML]Of course it is! You deserve the world,[N]
whether you acknowledge it or not.[AN]
You said it yourself. I'm giving you[N]
the life you always wanted.[AN]
If anyone must shoulder the sin of[N]
stealing these priceless treasures[Beat][AN]
well, let's say I've done worse.[AN]
[MR]Calvin, you shouldn't say such things[N]
in the presence of a priest.[AN]
[ML]Hey, if I go to hell for my sins, I[N]
know you'll put in a good word for me.[AN]
[MR]Indeed I will.[A] I love you, Calvin.[AN]
[ML]And I love you too, Clovis. When this[N]
battle ends, we'll begin our new lives.[A][X]
