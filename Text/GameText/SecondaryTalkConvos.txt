[ML][LoadDarina][MR][LoadEugenia]
[ML]Gene, who was that woman[N]
you were just talking to?[AN]
[MR]Dar, this is the third time I've told you.[AN]
That was Aleyna Platt, the captain[N]
of the company I hired last week.[AN]
You must take care to start[N]
remembering our business partners.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Well [Italics]excuse me[Normal] for not keeping[N]
every single client you negotiate[N]
a 0.56% rate decrease with straight.[AN]
They all start to blend together after
years of you venting about them.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Hey, it was a 0.77% rate decrease![AN]
And that's not the point![A] This gold is[N]
coming out of your coffers, not mine.[AN]
[ML]WHAT?! Gene, I'm the lord of this castle![AN]
You can't keep spending treasury gold[N]
without my permission![AN]
[MR]Why not? We live in same house, eat the[N]
same meals, sleep in the same bed[Beat][AN]
Barring the piece of paper declaring[N]
so, we're practically already married.[AN]
[ML]That's not true![A] Since when have[N]
we ever had time to eat together?![AN]
You're always too busy with work[N]
to pay attention to me.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]Well maybe if you actually took some[N]
responsibility, I wouldn't have to do[N]
all the bookkeeping around here.[AN]
I've sacrificed everything to keep our[N]
castle running smoothly, and this is[N]
the thanks I get?![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Hmph[Beat][AN]
[MR]Tsk[Beat][AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Do you want herb-crusted cod[N]
for dinner tonight? I'll cook.[AN]
[MR]Only if we use what I've been growing.[AN]
But consider that appointment scheduled.[A][X]

[ML][LoadCalvin][MR][LoadDuncan]
[MR]Calvin! Where the hell do you[N]
think you're skulking off to?[AN]
[ML]Yo, commander! Just taking a little[N]
detour to get behind enemy lines.[AN]
[MR]Uh huh. Sure. I'm onto you, you know.[AN]
Every so often one of my knights[N]
reports some stolen belongings.[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]It happens just irregularly enough[N]
to be passed off as unrelated,[N]
but I know a repeat culprit's MO.[AN]
Master thieves know to bide their[N]
time, wait for suspicion to die down,[N]
and only then go in for the kill.[AN]
I've watched you long enough to[N]
recognize your skill with a knife -[N]
not to mention your shifty eyes.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Is that really all the proof you've got?[AN]
Street smarts and a wary instinct do[N]
not tangible evidence make.[AN]
Unless you've got something conclusive,[N]
I'm going back to battle now.[AN]
These throats won't slice themselves![AN][CloseBox][ClearFace]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML][LoadCalvin]
[ML]Oh, one more thing.[A] I was spying earlier[N]
and overheard some enemy thieves talking.[AN]
Word has it they're gonna try to nab Vacille's[N]
Sacred Treasure in the chaos of war.[AN]
[MR]They're plotting to steal the Red Gem?![AN]
This cannot be allowed to pass![A] Knights![AN]
Guard the royal garden with your lives![AN]
Allow no enemy to cross its fences![AN][ClearFace]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Heh heh. So close, yet so far, [OpenQuote]Commander.[CloseQuote][A][X]

[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Ekaitz![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Need something, Boss? I'm a[N]
little preoccupied right now.[AN]
[MR]I saw you talking to a girl earlier.[AN]
I hope you didn't lose a bet to her. Or[N]
worse, convince her to give you a loan.[AN]
[ML]Hey, who do you think I am?[AN]
I'm an upstanding fella with a[N]
squeaky clean financial record.[AN]
[MR]That so? I'm in need of some advice, then.[AN]
How does a guy up to their throat in debts[N]
suddenly wipe that slate clean?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]You do what you gotta do. Steal a dead[N]
body, set fire to an old shed you were[N]
squatting in, fake your own death[Beat] twice.[AN]
Success not guaranteed the second time.[N]
Loan sharks start wising up to it.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]You're a failure of a man, you know that?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Damn straight! But this man-failure[N]
has the best aim in your company.[AN]
You want to keep me around, you[N]
protect me from any predators.[AN]
[MR]That's how we operate, Ekaitz.[AN]
I'll have your back, no matter[N]
what, so long as you do the same.[AN]
You earn your place with us, you[N]
can forget those sharks exist.[AN]
But keep slacking, and I'll feed[N]
you to them myself.[A] Capiche?[AN]
[ML]Capiche yourself. When push comes[N]
to shove, we'll see what you do.[AN]
Wouldn't be the first time I was[N]
baited by such honeyed words.[AN]
It'd be a damn shame if I had[N]
to change my name a third time.[AN]
I've already gone through all[N]
the good ones.[A][X]


## NiravClovisTalkConvo
[ML][LoadNirav][MR][LoadClovis]
[ML]Hm? Aren't you a priest? Why are[N]
you fighting in this battle?[AN]
[MR]I couldn't sit idly by when I heard[N]
Vacille territory had been invaded.[AN]
The people here took me in after I[N]
ran away from home. I owe them my life.[AN]
[ML]Oh, you ran away from home?[AN]
Please, you have to tell me more![AN]
How did you sever ties with your[N]
family so cleanly?![AN]
[MR]Peace, slow down. I'm sorry to disappoint,[N]
but my story isn't a very interesting one.[AN]
I was born into a well-off noble house[N]
as the son of a concubine.[AN]
Supposedly I was one of a pair of[N]
twins, but I've never met my sibling.[AN]
My mother never spoke about the-[AN]
[ML]I didn't ask for your life story![AN]
Just tell me how you got out of there.[AN]
[MR][MoMR]V-Very well. When I was seven, my mother[N]
decided I shouldn't grow up in the house.[AN]
One night, she smuggled me out of the[N]
estate hidden within a carriage.[AN]
[ML]I see. Damn, if only I was a scrawny[N]
7 year old who could fit in a carriage.[AN]
[MR]Is[Beat] something the matter, miss?[AN]
[ML]Shut it, priesty! I've got better things[N]
to do than listen to you blabber on.[AN]
Oh hey, there's a brigand with an[N]
axe coming your way. Watch out![AN][ClearFace]
[MR]Huh?! What? Where?[A] Hey, come back![AN]
Please, help me![A][X]

## EmersonSolineTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEmerson][MR][LoadSoline]
[ML]Good morning, Miss Charafei ma'am![AN]
I've brought you breakfast.[AN]
[MR]Thank you, Emerson, but we don't[N]
have time for breakfast today.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Hm? What do you- oh, you mean the battle![AN]
[Beat]W-Wait, what are you doing in battle?![AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]You should be resting in your room![N]
What if Lord Darina catches you?[AN]
[MR]That won't be an issue. But still, these old[N]
bones appreciate you keeping my secret.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Of course, ma'am! Squire's honor.[AN]
Is there anything else you need[N]
done while you're fighting here?[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]I can clean your chambers, cook your[N]
next meal, or give milord a stern[N]
talking-to about keeping your secret.[AN]
[MR]That won't be necessary, child.[AN]
Just knowing you're protecting me[N]
is enough to warm any icy heart.[AN]
Now scurry back to your duties.[AN]
I've got enough fight left in me[N]
to take these rascals on.[A][X]
