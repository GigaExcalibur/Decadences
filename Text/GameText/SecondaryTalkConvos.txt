[ML][LoadDarina][MR][LoadEugenia]
[ML]Gene, who was that woman[N]
you were just talking to?[AN]
[MR]Dar, I told you three times by now.[AN]
That was Aleyna, the mercenary[N]
captain I hired last week.[AN]
You must take care to start[N]
memorizing our business partners.[AN]
[ML]Well [Italics]excuse me[Normal] for not remembering[N]
every single client you manage to[N]
negotiate a 0.56% rate decreate with.[AN]
[MR]Hey, it was a 0.77% decrease![AN]
A-And that's not the point![AN]
This gold is coming out of[N]
your coffers, not mine.[AN]
[ML]WHAT?! Gene, you can't keep spending[N]
castle gold without my permission![AN]
[MR]Why not? We live in same house, eat the[N]
same meals, sleep in the same bed[Beat][AN]
[ML]That's not true! Since when have[N]
we ever had time to eat together?![AN]
You're always too busy with work[N]
to pay attention to me.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]Well maybe if you actually took some[N]
responsibility, I wouldn't have to do[N]
all the bookkeeping around here.[AN]
[ML]Hmph[Beat][AN]
[MR]Tsk[Beat][AN]
[ML]Do you want herb crusted cod for dinner?[N]
I'm going shopping after the battle ends.[AN]
[MR]Only if we use the herbs I've grown myself.[AN]
But I'll schedule that appointment now.[A][X]

## CalvinDuncanTalkConvo
[ML][LoadCalvin][MR][LoadDuncan]
[MR]Calvin! Where the hell are[N]
you skulking around to?[AN]
[ML]Yo, commander! Just taking a little[N]
detour to get behind enemy lines.[AN]
[MR]Uh huh. Yeah. Sure. I'm onto you.[AN]
Every so often one of my knights[N]
reports some stolen belongings.[AN]
You're the only one here skilled[N]
enough to pull it off so often.[AN]
[ML]And do you have any proof?[AN]
Cause if not, I'm just gonna[N]
go back to slicin' and dicin'.[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Oh, and one more thing.[A] I was spying[N]
earlier and overheard some enemy[N]
thieves talking.[AN]
Apparently they're gonna try to[N]
steal Vacille's Sacred Treasure[N]
in the chaos of the battle.[AN]
[MR]Egads! We must prevent this[N]
at all costs! Knights, to me![AN]
Begin fortifying the royal garden![AN]
Don't let a single enemy step[N]
foot within its fences![AN][ClearFace]
[ML]Heh heh. So close, yet[N]
so far, [OpenQuote]Commander.[CloseQuote][AN]

## AleynaEkaitzTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEkaitz][MR][LoadAleyna]
[MR]Ekaitz![AN]
[ML]Need something, Boss? I'm a[N]
little preoccupied right now.[AN]
[MR]I saw you talking to a girl earlier.[AN]
I hope you didn't lose a bet to her. Or[N]
worse, convince her to give you a loan.[AN]
[ML]Hey, who do you think I am?[AN]
I'm an upstanding fella with a[N]
squeaky clean financial record.[AN]
[MR]That so? I'm in need of some advice, then.[AN]
How does a guy up to their throat in debts[N]
suddenly wipe the slate clean?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]You do what you gotta do. Steal a dead[N]
body, set fire to an old shed you were[N]
squatting in, fake your own death[Beat] twice.[AN]
Success not guaranteed the second time.[N]
Loan sharks start getting their wits back.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]You're a failure of a man, you know that?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Damn straight! But this man-failure[N]
has the best aim in your company.[AN]
You want to keep me around, you[N]
hide me from any hungry sharks.[AN]
[MR]That's how we operate, Ekaitz.[AN]
I'll have your back, no matter[N]
what, so long as you do the same.[AN]
You earn your place with us, you[N]
can forget those sharks exist.[AN]
But keep slacking, and I'll feed[N]
you to them myself.[A] Capiche?[AN]
[ML]Capiche yourself. When push comes[N]
to shove, we'll see what you do.[AN]
Wouldn't be the first time I was[N]
baited by such honeyed words.[AN]
It'd be a damn shame if I had[N]
to change my name a third time.[AN]
I've already gone through all[N]
the good ones.[A][X]


## NiravClovisTalkConvo
[ML][LoadNirav][MR][LoadClovis]
[ML]Hm? Aren't you a priest? Why are[N]
you fighting in this battle?[AN]
[MR]I just couldn't sit idly by when I[N]
heard Vacille territory was invaded.[AN]
The people here took me in after I[N]
ran away from home. I owe them my life.[AN]
[ML]Oh, you ran away from home?[AN]
Please, you have to tell me more![AN]
[MR]Peace, slow down. I'm sorry to disappoint,[N]
but my story isn't very interesting.[AN]
I was born into a well-off noble house[N]
as the son of a concubine.[AN]
Supposedly I was one of a pair of[N]
twins, but I've never met my sibling.[AN]
My mother never spoke about the-[AN]
[ML]I didn't ask for your life story![AN]
Just tell me how you got here.[AN]
[MR][MoMR]V-very well. When I was seven, my mother[N]
decided I shouldn't grow up in the house.[AN]
One night, she smuggled me out of the[N]
estate hidden within a carriage.[AN]
[ML]I see. Damn, if only I was a scrawny[N]
7 year old who could fit in a carriage.[AN]
Oh well. I've got bigger problems now.[AN]
Hey priesty, there's an axe coming[N]
your way! Watch out![AN][ClearFace]
[MR]Huh?! What? Where?[A] Hey, come back![AN]
Please, help me![A][X]

## EmersonSolineTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEmerson][MR][LoadSoline]
[ML]Good morning, Miss Charafei ma'am![AN]
I've brought you breakfast.[AN]
[MR]Thank you, Emerson, but we don't[N]
have time for breakfast today.[AN]
[ML]Hm? What do you- oh, you mean the battle![AN]
[Beat]Wait, what are you doing in the battle?![AN]
You should be resting in your room![N]
What if Lord Darina catches you?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]That won't be an issue. But still,[N]
these old bones appreciate you[N]
keeping my secret so tightly.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Of course, ma'am! Squire's honor.[AN]
Is there anything else you need[N]
done while you're fighting here?[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]I can clean your chambers, cook your[N]
next meal, or give milord a stern[N]
talking-to about keeping your secret.[AN]
[MR]That won't be necessary, child.[AN]
Just knowing you're protecting me[N]
is enough to warm any cold heart.[AN]
Now scurry back to your duties.[AN]
I've got enough fight left in me[N]
to take these oppugnants on.[A][X]
