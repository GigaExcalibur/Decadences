[ML][Beat]Why the hell are you showing[N]
your face around here again?[AN]
[MR]Money's tight these days.[AN]
Gotta find work somewhere.[AN]

[ML]Is that all you have to say to me?![AN]
14 years ago, you left without a word.[AN]
You were Lord Quinton's closest[N]
retainer.[A] Why did you abandon us?![AN]
[MR]Duncan, do you remember the day[N]
we were chosen as retainers?[AN]
[MR]Of course. We were ecstatic to finally escape[N]
poverty and find a cause to fight for.[AN]
[ML]Yes. You, in particular, were overjoyed[N]
to serve under Quinton's banner.[AN]
You said you followed the [OpenQuote]warrior's creed[CloseQuote],[AN]
that barbaric statement of purpose declaring[N]
all men should die young in battle.[AN]
[MR]Do you have a problem with the creed?[AN]
Because my fate is none of your business.[AN]
[ML]No, it is my business! Do you warriors ever[N]
think about the people you leave behind?![AN]
We've known each other our entire lives.[AN]
I care about you.[A] That's why the thought[N]
of seeing you killed in battle hurts me so.[AN]
[MR]Aleyna, you know as well I as that[N]
such a fate is inevitable for me.[AN]
[ML]Why do you think I left?[AN]
To spare myself the pain and[N]
heartbreak of losing you too soon.[AN]
And yet, as the years passed, I[N]
found myself unable to forget you.[AN]
[MR][Beat]What do you want now, Aleyna?[AN]
[ML]The same thing since I was a child.[AN]
For us to live long and share as much[N]
of our miserable lives as possible.[N]
Is that so hard to understand?[AN]
Or does your warrior's creed[N]
forbid human connection too?[AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
[ML]For what it's worth, I was glad[N]
to serve as Quinton's retainer.[AN]
And I'm sorry I couldn't be there[N]
during his final moments.[A] Truly.[AN]
[MR]Will you leave again when the battle ends?[AN]
[ML]No.[A] I'm done running from my feelings.[AN]
If you're so intent on plunging yourself into[N]
the abyss, I'll drag you out of it myself![AN]
[MR][Beat]Do what you will.[A] I won't let you[N]
distract me from my duty, but[Beat][AN]
[ML]But?[AN]
[MR]I confess it's a relief to fight[N]
alongside you again, old friend.[AN]
Come, let us make Lord Quinton proud![A][X]

[ML]So, she's decided to fly the coop, huh?[AN]
Good luck, kid.[A] It's a tough world out there.[A][X]
