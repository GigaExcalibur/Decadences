[FL][LoadCalvin][L][LoadEugenia][R][LoadDarina][FR][LoadDuncan]
[FL]Milord! I bring word on Mogus' movements.[AN]
They'll storm the castle tomorrow morning.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[R][MoR]Tomorrow?![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[L]Damn, already? Seems those bastards[N]
gave us less time than we expected.[AN]
[R]Eugenia, what's the status[N]
on our provisions and arms?[AN]
[L]Insufficient even for routing brigands, let[N]
alone repelling a large-scale invasion.[AN]
[FR]What we need isn't arms, but men[N]
to swing them. We're undermanned.[AN]
We need more allies, we can't hold[N]
a castle with the forces we have.[AN]
[FL]Pause your debate for a minute.[N]
I've got more important news.[AN]
Milord. I have two missives for you:[N]
one from Clarvo, one from Mogus.[AN]
[L]Mogus? What could those mouth-breathing[N]
hooligans want to write you about, Dar?[AN]
[FR]Any information is good information.[N]
Open the letter, Lord Darina.[A][X]

## MogusMissive
To the steward of Transigent Castle,[AN]
my name is Samuli. I am the high[N]
commander of the great army of Mogus.[AN]
We have observed your rule these past[N]
seven years, and we deem you unworthy.[AN]
You merely sit on your throne and bow[N]
your head to those filthy Clarvoans.[AN]
And yet, you have the power to break[N]
the chains that bind you.[AN]
Willingly surrender Transigent Castle[N]
to us, and we may spare your lives.[AN]
We will liberate your territory and[N]
grant your citizens their freedom![AN]
I've left this missive for your spy[N]
to deliver as an offer and warning.[AN]
There is no need to respond. We will[N]
know your decision on the battlefield.[A][X]

## PostMogusMissiveDialogue
[FL][LoadCalvin][L][LoadEugenia][R][LoadDarina][FR][LoadDuncan]
[L]Do those brutes mean to threaten us?[AN]
[FR]Obviously not. If they wanted us dead and[N]
buried, they would not have sent this.[AN]
Will you be taking their offer into[N]
consideration, milord?[AN]
[R]I-I'm not sure.[AN]
[L]We still have Clarvo's missive[N]
to read. Calvin, if you would.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[FL]With pleasure, Lady Lentz![A][X]

## ClarvoMissive
For the eyes of Darina von Vacille.[AN]
I am the illustrious Maximilia Bri,[N]
high commander of the Clarvoan military.[AN]
I trust I need not remind you that[N]
holding this castle is your obligation.[AN]
Your father, and his fathers before[N]
him, all swore fealty to Clarvo.[AN]
As the inheritor to that legacy,[N]
you must act in accordance with them.[AN]
Now, as our loyal vassal, you are[N]
entitled to material support from us.[AN]
The Lentz family has offered to supply[N]
you with weaponry, should you need it.[AN]
But if you spurn our generosity and[N]
betray your divine duty to us,[AN]
we will raze your house to ashes.[AN]
Do not reply to this missive. We[N]
shall know your answer tomorrow.[A][X]

## PostClarvoMissiveDialogue
[FL][LoadCalvin][L][LoadEugenia][R][LoadDarina][FR][LoadDuncan]
[FR]Do those bastards really think[N]
they can walk all over us?![AN]
[L]Are they wrong, though? House Vacille[N]
has been nothing but loyal to Clarvo.[AN]
Admittedly, they could stand to be[N]
less[Beat] condescending about it.[AN]
[FR]The kingdom invading our borders writing a[N]
nicer letter than the one we're protecting[Beat][AN]
What has this world come to?[AN]
[L]Cease the philosophizing, Duncan. We[N]
have more urgent business to attend to.[AN]
Darina. As lord of this castle, our stance[N]
in this conflict depends entirely on you.[AN]
Make your choice.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[R]Hells, why does this have to be so hard?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[FR]We're by your side. Just think it through.[AN]
[FR]You've heard both kingdom's ultimatums,[N]
milord. Which one will you side with?[A][X]

[FL][LoadCalvin][L][LoadEugenia][R][LoadDarina][FR][LoadDuncan]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[R]I can't decide like this! I need more information.[AN]
[L]Very well, then. What else do you need to know?[AN]
[R]Um[Beat] everything. About every kingdom.[AN]
[FL][Beat][AN]
[FR][Beat][AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[R]I-If you want to blame anyone, blame my father[N]
for dying before he taught me how to lead![AN]
[FR]Very well then. Here's the basic summary.[AN]
The kingdoms of Clarvo and Mogus control the[N]
territory on each side of the Amical River.[AN]
The entity that directly controls the river's[N]
territory is House Vacille.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[L]That's us, Dar.[AN]
[R]I know that much, at least![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[FR]Your ancestors have allied with the[N]
Clarvoans for their entire history.[AN]
Which is why Transigent Castle is[N]
built on their side of the river.[AN]
[FL]As[Beat] riveting as this exposition is,[N]
we should get to more practical matters.[AN]
[L]Of course. Dar, you're well aware that I'm[N]
a member of an elite merchant family.[AN]
If we choose to side with Clarvo, they'll[N]
[Red]supply us with extra equipment[Red].[AN]
[FR]Despite their current aggression, the[N]
Mogusans are an honorable people.[AN]
They fight for the freedom of others,[N]
presupposed as it may be.[AN]
If we side with them, it's likely[N]
we'll [Red]receive additional soldiers[Red].[A][X]
