## DarinaSolineTalkConvo
[ML][LoadDarina][MR][LoadSoline]
[ML]Hey! Pardon me, I don't recognize you.[AN]
I am the illustrious Lord Darina von[N]
Vacille, the ruler of this castle.[AN]
Explain yourself right this second,[N]
or you shall be tossed in the dungeon![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]Bah! Such audacity from you whippersnappers.[N]
Back in my day, we'd never question what a[N]
strange old woman was on a battlefield for.[AN]
Don't you young'uns respect your elders[N]
anymore?![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML][MoML]Ah, my deepest apologies, ma'am![AN]
I had no idea my actions offended[N]
you so deeply.[AN]
[CloseEyes]My father taught me proper etiquette,[N]
but I can never remember when to say what.[AN]
I'll leave you alone now. It won't[N]
happen again, I swear! I-I promise![AN][MoFFL]
[FFL]On the honor of House Vacille's name![AN]
[MR][Beat]My, that was easier than I thought.[N]
You've raised a good kid, Quinton.[A][X]

## EugeniaAleynaTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEugenia][MR][LoadAleyna]
[ML]Good afternoon, Ms. Platt.[N]
How are you faring today?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[MR]Greetings, Eugenia. You can spare the[N]
pleasantries, we both know this is[N]
just business.[AN]
[ML]Very well, then. I was reviewing the[N]
terms of our contract, and I noticed[N]
a small stipulation you snuck in.[AN]
[OpenQuote]While in the employ of House Vacille,[N]
Aleyna's Mercenaries must be under the[N]
direct command of Darina von Vacille.[CloseQuote][AN]
Ms. Platt, we're both well aware of[N]
our dear lord's leadership skills.[AN]
Why add this stipulation?[AN]
[MR]That's none of your business, Eugenia.[AN]
You paid me to be your hired muscle,[N]
not question my decisions.[AN]
Now get behind me. It would be a[N]
shame to die after spending all[N]
that gold hiring my company.[A][X]

[FR][LoadCalvin][MR][LoadClovis]
[FR]Surprise![AN]
[MR][MoMR]AH![AN][MoML][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadClovis]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Calvin, what was that for?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[FR][MoMR]No reason. I just like seeing that[N]
beautiful face of yours all flustered.[AN]
[ML]You're so lucky I love you, otherwise[N]
I'd have your soul damned by now.[AN]
[MR]I know that. And for your kindness, I got[N]
you a gift:[....] a basket of fushcia dark eyes.[AN]
They're shrubs, so they can't put in a[N]
bouquet, but still just as gorgeous.[N]
petals are beautiful just as they are.[AN]
[ML]Oh, it's perfect! It almost feels like[N]
each basket is bigger than the last.[AN]
Where do you get the flowers, anyway?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Nowhere special, just the castle garden.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML][MoML]The castle garden? Are you really[N]
allowed to take flowers from there?[AN]
[MR]Of course! Lord Darina and I are buddy-buddy.[N]
[OpenQuote]Su casa es mi casa[CloseQuote] and all that.[AN]
[ML]Are you sure you haven't been stealing? When[N]
you confessed to me, you said you changed.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Of course I've changed! I used to steal only[N]
for myself, but now I give everything to you.[AN]
[ML]Aw, you're so sweet. I'm going back to[N]
battle now, but I appreciate the flowers.[AN][ClearFace]
[MR][Beat]Clovis, I'm going to give you the entire[N]
world.[A] The only way I know how.[A][X]

## DuncanEmersonTalkConvo
[ML][LoadDuncan][MR][LoadEmerson]
[ML]Emerson! The hell are you doing out[N]
here? This is an active war zone![AN]
[MR][MoMR]I'm gonna contribute to the fight, sir![N]
I can do it, sir, I'm strong enough, sir![AN]
[ML]Like hell you are. Your arms are shaking[N]
like a leaf trying to lift that lance.[AN]
Your posture is unsteady. Your form is[N]
unrefined. You'll be snapped like a twig.[AN]
[MR]You're wrong, sir! I've been training[N]
all day and all night to get strong, sir![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]If that's as strong as you can get, and[N]
your everyday brigand can cleave you in[N]
two, then you're no squire of mine.[AN]
You really think you're gonna avenge[N]
your parents at this rate?![AN]
[MR]N-no, sir! I'm going to train[N]
even harder, sir![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Good! Glad to hear it. Once this battle is[N]
over, I'll let you whale on me for a bit.[AN]
It's the least I can do for your parents.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Thank you very much, sir! That's[N]
all I could ever ask for, sir![A][X]

[MR][LoadEkaitz][ML][LoadNirav]
[MR]Whoa, hey there lady. Didn't realize we[N]
had such a dignified presence in our[N]
ranks. May I ask you for your name?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML][Beat]Excuse me?
[ML]Sure, maybe for a tea party. Shall I call[N]
my butler over to serve biscuits, then?[AN][CloseBox]
[ML][OpenQuote][Italics]Oh Nirav, you[Normal]'[Italics]re just as beautiful as[N]
the trill of your name off my tongue.[Normal][CloseQuote][A][X]
