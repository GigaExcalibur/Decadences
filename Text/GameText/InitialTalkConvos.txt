[ML]Hey! Pardon me, I don't recognize you.[AN]
I am the illustrious Lord Darina von[N]
Vacille, the ruler of this castle.[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
Explain yourself right this second,[N]
or[Beat] um[Beat] oh! Or you shall be-[....][N]
no, I will toss you in the dungeon![AN]
[MR]Bah! Such audacity from you whippersnappers.[AN]
Back in my day, we'd never question what a[N]
strange old woman was on a battlefield for.[AN]
Don't you young'uns respect your elders[N]
anymore?! You should be ashamed![AN]
[ML][MoML]AH! Wah, my deepest apologies, ma'am![N]
I never meant to offend you so deeply.[AN]
I'm sorry! I'm really, truly, sorry![AN]
[CloseEyes]My father taught me proper etiquette,[N]
but I can never remember when to say what.[AN]
I'll leave you alone now. It won't[N]
happen again, I swear! I-I promise![AN][ClearFace]
[MR][Beat]My, that was easier than I thought.[N]
You've raised a good kid, Quinton.[A][X]

## EugeniaAleynaTalkConvo
[ML][LoadEugenia][MR][LoadAleyna]
[ML]Good afternoon, Ms. Platt.[N]
It's a lovely day, isn't it?[AN]
Is your company faring well?[AN]
[MR]Eugenia. Spare the pleasantries.[N]
I know you're here on business.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Hm. Nothing gets by you, I see.[AN]
I was reviewing the terms of our[N]
contract, and I noticed that you[N]
snuck in a small stipulation.[AN]
[OpenQuote]While in the employ of House Vacille,[N]
Aleyna's Mercenaries must be under the[N]
direct command of Darina von Vacille.[CloseQuote][AN][CloseBox]
[ML]Ms. Platt, we both know the quality of[N]
our dear lord's leadership skills.[AN]
Why endanger yourselves so?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Want to pay me to answer that?[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
Cause I can. But it'll be coming out[N]
of the gold you gave me to keep an[N]
axe out of your dear lord's backside.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML][Beat][AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Feh. I've talked too much for one fight.[N]
Less gabbing, more stabbing, Eugenia.[A][X]

## CalvinClovisTalkConvo
[FR][LoadCalvin][MR][LoadClovis]
[FR]Surprise![AN]
[MR][MoMR]AH![AN][MoML][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadClovis]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[ML]Calvin, what was that for?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[FR][MoMR]No reason. I just like seeing that[N]
beautiful face of yours all flustered.[AN]
[ML]You're so lucky I love you, otherwise[N]
I'd have condemned your soul by now.[AN]
[MR]I know that. And for your kindness, I got[N]
you a gift:[....] a basket of fuchsia dark eyes.[AN]
They're shrubs, so they can't be arranged[N]
in a bouquet, but still just as gorgeous.[AN]
[ML]Oh, it's perfect! It almost feels like[N]
each basket is bigger than the last.[AN]
Where do you get the flowers, anyway?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Nowhere special, just the castle garden.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML][MoML]The castle garden? Are you really[N]
allowed to take flowers from there?[AN]
[MR]Of course! Lord Darina and I are buddy-buddy.[N]
[OpenQuote]Su casa es mi casa[CloseQuote] and all that.[AN]
[ML]Are you sure you haven't been stealing? When[N]
you confessed to me, you said you changed.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[MR]Of course I've changed! I used to steal only[N]
for myself, but now I give everything to you.[AN]
[ML]Aw, you're so sweet.[A] I'm going back to[N]
battle now, but I appreciate the flowers.[AN][ClearFace]
[MR][Beat]Clovis, I'm going to give you the entire[N]
world.[A] The only way I know how.[A][X]

## DuncanEmersonTalkConvo
[ML][LoadDuncan][MR][LoadEmerson]
[ML]Emerson! The hell are you doing out[N]
here? This is an active war zone![AN]
[MR][MoMR]I'm gonna contribute to the fight, sir![N]
I can do it, sir, I'm strong enough, sir![AN]
[ML]Like hell you are. Your arms are shaking[N]
like a leaf trying to lift that lance.[AN]
Your posture is unsteady. Your form is[N]
unrefined. You'll be snapped like a twig.[AN]
[MR]You're wrong, sir! I've been training[N]
all day and all night to get strong, sir![AN]
[ML]If your [OpenQuote]strength[CloseQuote] can be cleft in two by[N]
a brigand's axe, you're no squire of mine.[AN]
You really think you're gonna avenge[N]
your parents at this rate?![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]O-of course not, sir![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Even since I took you in after your[N]
parents died, you've been nothing[N]
but a bunch of empty promises.[AN]
If you want to get strong enough to[N]
avenge them, then show me results![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Yes, sir! I understand, sir![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML]Good! Glad to hear it. Once this battle is[N]
over, I'll let you whale on me for a bit.[AN]
It's the least I can do for your parents.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Thank you very much, sir![A][X]

## EkaitzNiravTalkConvo
[MR][LoadEkaitz][ML][LoadNirav]
[ML]Hey![A] You![A] Boor with the bow! Stop[N]
slacking on the battlefield![AN]
[MR]Me, a slacker? Your words wound me.[AN]
In life, you've gotta stop and smell[N]
the roses every once in a while.[AN]
What's your name, little lady?[AN]
[ML][Italics]Excuse me[Normal]? Do you really think we have[N]
time for such idle conversation?[AN]
What do you think this is, a tea party?[AN]
Let me just call my butler over to[N]
serve us biscuits as well, then.[AN]
We'll have all the time in the[N]
world to talk about each other.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[MR]Uh, lady? Is something wrong?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[ML]Ha[Beat] ha ha ha! Of course! Why would[N]
there ever be anything wrong with[N]
introductions over tea and biscuits?[AN][CloseBox]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[ML][OpenQuote][Italics]Oh Nirav, you[Normal]'[Italics]re just as beautiful as[N]
the trill of your name off my tongue.[AN]
My name is Gustavo, and House Dewan[N]
just accepted my proposal to you.[Normal][CloseQuote][AN][CloseBox]
[ML]Haha! How quaint![A] How wonderful![AN]
How spendid tea parties are![AN]
Wouldn't you agree, you fool?![AN]
[MR]I[Beat] uh, I'm going back to the battle now.[AN]
Just try not to lose yourself, y'hear?[A][X]
